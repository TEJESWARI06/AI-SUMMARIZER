# AI Summarizer

A simple **AI-based Text Summarizer** built in Python that can generate concise summaries from long paragraphs, articles, or documents. This project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract or generate meaningful summaries.

## Features
- **Summarize Text** from large paragraphs or documents.  
- **Extractive Summarization** (picks key sentences).  
- **Abstractive Summarization** (rephrases content in shorter form).  
- **Easy Input Options**: Paste text directly or load from files.  
- **Fast & Efficient**: Provides summaries instantly.  
- **Customizable**: Change summary length as per user need.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**  
- **NLTK / SpaCy** → for natural language processing  
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** → for abstractive summarization  
- **Sumy** → for extractive summarization  
- **Tkinter / Streamlit (optional)** → for simple GUI/web interface

## How It Works
1. User inputs text (paragraph, article, or document).  
2. The system processes the text using NLP techniques.  
3. Extracts keywords and identifies the most relevant sentences (Extractive).  
4. Or re-generates shorter sentences using transformer models (Abstractive).  
5. Outputs a concise summary.

## Example Usage
**Input Text:**  
_"Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries by enabling machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions."_  

**Output Summary:**  
_"AI enables machines to perform human-like tasks such as language understanding and decision-making."_

## Future Enhancements
- **Support for Multiple File Formats** (PDF, DOCX, TXT).  
- **Summarization of Web Pages / URLs** directly.  
- **Integration with Voice Assistants** to read summaries aloud.  
- **Multi-language Summarization** for global use.  
- **AI-Powered Abstractive Models** for more natural summaries.  
- **Web App / Mobile App Interface** for easy access.
